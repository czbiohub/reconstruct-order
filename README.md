# ReconstructOrder

Analyze density (bright-field, phase), anisotropy (birefringence, slow axis), and degree of polarization of specimens from polarization-resolved and depth-resolved images. The acquisition, calibration, background correction, and reconstruction algorithms are described in the following preprint and paper:

## Updated software

We have now added support for Micro-Manager 2.0 and developed a [napari plugin](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/recOrder-napari) for QLIPP. The corresponding GitHub repository is [recOrder](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder). `reconstruct-order` is no longer maintained.

## Introduction 

As an illustration, following figure shows inputs and outputs of the ReconstructOrder for polarization-resolved data acquired at 21 consecutive focal planes with 2D phase reconstruction algorithm.

![Data_flow](Fig_Readme.png)

ReconstructOrder currently supports data format acquired using Micro-Manager 1.4.22 multi-dimension acquisition ([link](https://micro-manager.org/)) and OpenPolScope acquisition plugin ([link](https://openpolscope.org/)). We will add support for Micro-Manager 2.0 format in the next release.



## Installation

### Create a new conda environment (optional, but recommended)
>Install conda package management system by installing anaconda or miniconda ([link](https://conda.io/)). 
>Creating a conda environment dedicated to ReconstructOrder will avoid version conflicts among packages required by ReconstructOrder and packages required by other python software.
>
>```buildoutcfg
>conda create -n <your-environment-name> python=3.7
>conda activate <your-environment-name>
>```

#### All code blocks below assume you are in the above environment

### Option 1: install released version via pip
>ReconstructOrder is available on pip.  Running pip install will also install dependencies.
>From your environment created above, type:
>```buildoutcfg
>pip install ReconstructOrder
>```

### Option 2: install developer version via git
>Install the git version control system git : [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
>
>Use git to clone this repository to your current directory:
>```buildoutcfg
>git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/reconstruct-order.git
>```
You cab install dependencies via pip (python index package) or run ReconstructOrder inside a docker container with the dependencies pre-installed
> * #### install dependencies via pip
>  
>>    If you are running ReconstructOrder on your own machine, <br>
>>
>>    a) navigate to the cloned repository:
>>
>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    cd reconstruct-order
>>    ```
>>    <br>
>>    b) install python library dependencies:
>>
>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    pip install -r requirements.txt
>>    ```
>>    <br>
>>    c) Create a symbolic library link with setup.py:
>>
>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    python setup.py develop
>>    ```

> * #### Running inside a docker container
>
> If you are running ReconstructOrder on a compute node (e.g., fry2@czbiohub), it is recommended to run it in 
> a Docker container. 
> Docker is the virtual environment with all the required libraries pre-installed so you can run your copy of 
> ReconstructOrder without recreating the environment.
> The docker image for ReconstructOrder has been built on fry2@czbiohub. 
> If you are running ReconstructOrder on other servers, you can build the docker image after cloning the repository 
> by doing :    

>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    docker build -t reconstruct_order:py37 -f Dockerfile.ReconstructOrder .
>>    ```

>>    Now, to start a docker container, do 
>>    ```buildoutcfg
>>    docker run -it  -v /data/<your data dir>/:<data dir name inside docker>/ -v ~/ReconstructOrder:/ReconstructOrder reconstruct_order:py37 bash
>>    ```


*ReconstructOrder supports NVIDIA GPU computation through cupy package, please follow [here](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for installation (check cupy is properly installed by ```import cupy```). To enable gpu processing, set ```processing: use_gpu: True``` in the configuration file.*

## Usage
>The reconstruction parameters are specified in the configuration file.  
> Configuration file template(```config_example.yml```) can be found [here](https://github.com/mehta-lab/reconstruct-order) under ```examples``` folder, which incluides detailed explanation of parameters for running ReconstructOrder in different modes
>
> To use the configuration file template for your data, you need to at least modify ```dataset: data_dir``` and ```dataset: processed_dir``` to point to source data path and output path. See the template docstrings for the usage of other parameters.
>
> #### There are two ways to run reconstruction:
>>* #### from command line
>>   If you pip installed the library, from any folder, simply type:
>>   ```buildoutcfg
>>   runReconstruction --config path-and-name-to-your-config.yml
>>   ```
>>
>>   or 
>>   ```buildoutcfg
>>   python runReconstruction.py --config path-and-name-to-your-config.yml
>>   ```
>>   if you the symlink wasn't set up. 
>
>>* #### Inside Python scripts 
>>   To call ReconstructOrder as a library in your own script to run reconstruction:
>>   ```buildoutcfg
>>   import ReconstructOrder.workflow as wf
>>   wf.reconstruct_batch('path-and-name-to-your-config.yml')
>>   ```

## Example
In the following, we demonstrate how to download our example dataset (hosted [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1axmPgQVNi22ZqGLXzHGHIuP9kA93K9zH)) and run ReconstructOrder on it to get birefringence and phase images. This instruction should work for installation from both Option 1 and 2. <br>

a) In the terminal, switch to the environment with ReconstructOrder installed 
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  conda activate <your-environment-name>
>  ```

b) Navigate to the repository folder:
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  cd reconstruct-order
>  ```

c) Download example dataset:
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  python DownloadExample.py

The example datasets will be downloaded and upzipped in the ```data_downloaded``` folder, together with the configuration files. <br>

d) Run ReconstructOrder on the downloaded dataset, e.g. MouseBrain dataset:
>   ```buildoutcfg
>  python runReconstruction.py --config ./data_downloaded/MouseBrain/config.yml
    
e) The reconstructed images will be saved the ```data_downloaded``` folder. You can reconstruct other downloaded datasets following the above steps, or change the parameters in the configuration file and observe the changes in the output images.
